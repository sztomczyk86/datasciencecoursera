    Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project by Szymon Tomczyk
                               using
      Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The following files were produced as part of the assignmetn:

-- CodeBook.md -> description of the applied transformations and 
                  new variables obtained

-- run_analysis.R -> R script used to combine the two original data-sets, 
                     tidy and summarise them


The used dataset was made available as a part of a publication:

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. 
Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass 
Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient 
Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012
